# Correct double rounding

The seven theorems from §5.2 / Fig. 9 of the paper. Proofs follow Appendix A.

Each theorem is stated *spec-relationally*: given that `z` is the rounding of
`x` in `F₂` and `w` is the rounding of `z` in `F₁`, conclude that `w` is also
the rounding of `x` in `F₁`. This matches the paper's reasoning style and
sidesteps having to define `rnd` constructively.

The overflow conditions on `b` from Fig. 9 are not needed in this formulation:
they ensure that the rounded values *exist*, not that the relationship holds.
The spec form takes existence of `z` and `w` as hypotheses.

/-- **rnd-RTZ-RTZ** (Fig. 9). If `F₁ ⊆ F₂` and the chained RTZ-rounding
`(F₂, RTZ) ; (F₁, RTZ)` produces results `z` and `w`, then `w` is also the
RTZ-rounding of `x` in `F₁` directly. -/
